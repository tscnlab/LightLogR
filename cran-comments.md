## Resubmission #1 (Version 0.3.8)

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* changed the \link{} targets only referring to packages and not to functions within other packages to \pkg{}.

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.

## Windevel results

Maintainer: 'Johannes Zauner <johannes.zauner@tum.de>'

* New submission

* Found the following (possibly) invalid URLs:
    URL: https://lists.lrz.de/mailman/listinfo/lightlogr-users
      From: README.md

This URL is valid, but the server does not allow the Windevel server to access it. The URL leads to the mailing list for the package.
