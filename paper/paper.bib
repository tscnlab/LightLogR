    abstract = {Light profoundly impacts many aspects of human physiology and behaviour, including the synchronization of the circadian clock, the production of melatonin, and cognition. These effects of light, termed the non-visual effects of light, have been primarily investigated in laboratory settings, where light intensity, spectrum and timing can be carefully controlled to draw associations with physiological outcomes of interest. Recently, the increasing availability of wearable light loggers has opened the possibility of studying personal light exposure in free-living conditions where people engage in activities of daily living, yielding findings associating aspects of light exposure and health outcomes, supporting the importance of adequate light exposure at appropriate times for human health. However, comprehensive protocols capturing environmental (e.g., geographical location, season, climate, photoperiod) and individual factors (e.g., culture, personal habits, behaviour, commute type, profession) contributing to the measured light exposure are currently lacking. Here, we present a protocol that combines smartphone-based experience sampling (experience sampling implementing Karolinska Sleepiness Scale, KSS ratings) and high-quality light exposure data collection at three body sites (near-corneal plane between the two eyes mounted on spectacle, neck-worn pendant/badge, and wrist-worn watch-like design) to capture daily factors related to individuals{\textquoteright} light exposure. We will implement the protocol in an international multi-centre study to investigate the environmental and socio-cultural factors influencing light exposure patterns in Germany, Ghana, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and Turkey (minimum n=15, target n=30 per site, minimum n=90, target n=180 across all sites). With the resulting dataset, lifestyle and context-specific factors that contribute to healthy light exposure will be identified. This information is essential in designing effective public health interventions.},

    abstract = {Light exposure profoundly influences human health, regulating circadian rhythms and impacting wakefulness and sleepiness. Estimating the effects of light exposure under everyday conditions requires personal, wearable light logging and dosimetry approaches. This article introduces the MeLiDos Project (2023–2026), supported by the European Association of National Metrology Institutes (EURAMET). The project's first branch defines quality indices and calibration standards for wearable light loggers, adapting existing metrological standards to their smaller size and distinct purpose in the field rather than the laboratory. The second branch develops a software ecosystem, including the open-source R software package LightLogR, designed to manage the increasing volume of data, ensuring reusability, accessibility and interoperability of data. The third branch explores the potential of spatially resolved light dosimetry. The MeLiDos Project anticipates advancements in wearable light metrology, paving the way for optimizing human health and well-being through wearable light logging technologies.}

    abstract = {Summary The interplay of daily life factors, including mood, physical activity, or light exposure, influences sleep architecture and quality. Laboratory-based studies often isolate these determinants to establish causality, thereby sacrificing ecological validity. Furthermore, little is known about time-of-year changes in sleep and circadian-related variables at high resolution, including the magnitude of individual change across time of year under real-world conditions. The Ecology of Human Sleep (EcoSleep) cohort study will investigate the combined impact of sleep determinants on individuals’ daily sleep episodes to elucidate which waking events modify sleep patterns. A second goal is to describe high-resolution individual sleep and circadian-related changes across the year to understand intra- and inter-individual variability. This study is a prospective cohort study with a measurement-burst design. Healthy adults aged 18–35 years (N = 12) will be enrolled for 12 months. Participants will continuously wear actimeters and pendant-attached light loggers. A subgroup will also measure interstitial fluid glucose levels (six paticipants). Every 4 weeks, all participants will undergo three consecutive measurement days of four ecological momentary assessments each day (‘bursts’) to sample sleep determinants during wake. Participants will also continuously wear temperature loggers (iButtons) during the bursts. Body weight will be captured before and after the bursts in the laboratory. The bursts will be separated by two at-home electroencephalogram recordings each night. Circadian phase and amplitude will be estimated during the bursts from hair follicles, and habitual melatonin onset will be derived through saliva sampling. Environmental parameters (bedroom temperature, humidity, and air pressure) will be recorded continuously.}
