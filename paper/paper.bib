	abstract = {Light synchronises the internal clock with the external light-dark cycle. Keeping this alignment benefits health and prevents diseases. Quantifying light exposure is, therefore, vital for effective prevention. Since light exposure depends on photoperiod, culture, and behaviour, we investigated objective light exposure and individual light-related behaviour in Switzerland and Malaysia. In this observational field study, participants (N=39) wore a calibrated melanopic light logger at chest level for 30 consecutive days. At baseline and study end, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was assessed, and every 3 to 4 days, the Light Exposure Behaviour Assessment (LEBA) was filled. Our pre-registered analyses reveal that participants in Switzerland experienced brighter days (+3.16 times the average mEDI) and spent more time (x1.9 times the duration) in daylight levels per hour of daylight, had \~{}1.5h later bright light exposure in the afternoon, and stayed over 1h longer in dim light conditions before bedtime. LEBA scores did not differ between Malaysia and Switzerland, and LEBA items were stable over time. LEBA items also correlated with objective light exposure variables in Switzerland but not Malaysia, with a medium effect size (range of absolute r=0.32-0.48). These results highlight cultural and geographical differences in light exposure. We showed that LEBA can be related to actual light exposure and is ecologically informative, but this varies by culture.Competing Interest StatementOS is listed as an inventor on the following patents: "Display system having a circadian effect on humans", US8646939B2; "Projection system and method for projecting image content", DE102010047207B4; "Adaptive lighting system", US8994292B2; "Projection device and filter therefor", WO2006013041A1; "Method for the selective adjustment of a desired brightness and/or colour of a specific spatial area, and data processing device", WO2016092112A1.

	abstract = {Light influences human physiology and behaviour by regulating circadian rhythms, melatonin secretion, and alertness. Previous research has reported sex differences in melatonin secretion and circadian rhythms, possibly related to women{\textquoteright}s greater sensitivity to bright light. Other studies have suggested reduced photosensitivity and earlier circadian phases in summer than in winter in mid-latitude regions. This study explores the effects of sex, seasonality, and their combination on melatonin suppression and subjective sleepiness in response to moderate light exposure, considering prior light history and menstrual phases in females. We conducted a controlled, within-subject experiment with 48 healthy adults (18{\textendash}35 years, 50\% female) across different seasons. The study design included two 9-h laboratory sessions, with at least 5-day washout in between. Participants were exposed to dim and moderate light through a screen for 2 hours after their habitual bedtime. Female participants exhibited greater melatonin suppression (+4.69 \%) but a lower alerting response (-6.00\%) to moderate light compared to males. Both sexes demonstrated increased sensitivity to the NIF effects of light in winter, with stronger melatonin suppression (+18.05 \%) and increased alertness (+7.60 \%) compared to summer. While prior light history did not significantly impact melatonin suppression or alertness, it was associated with an earlier dim light melatonin onset (DLMO). Females during their luteal phase had earlier DLMO than those in their follicular phase. Our findings indicate an interaction between sex, seasonality, and light exposure in modulating melatonin suppression, emphasising the need for personalised light exposure recommendations according to individual biological and environmental contexts.Competing Interest StatementF.F., R.L., and F.Y. declare no conflict of interest related to lighting.

ABSTRACT = {Understanding user challenges with light dosimeters is crucial for designing more acceptable devices and advancing light exposure research. We systematically evaluated the usability and acceptability of a light dosimeter (lido) with 29 participants who wore the dosimeter near the corneal plane of the eye for 5 days. Common reasons for not wearing the dosimeter included exercise, recharging, wet environments, public places, and discomfort. Despite these issues, participants adhered to using the dosimeter with high compliance (89% of recording time). Our findings revealed a significant discrepancy between mean (300 lxmEDI) and median (51 lxmEDI) melanopic equivalent daylight illuminance. This discrepancy indicates that the participants were exposed to significantly lower light levels most of the time. Specifically, participants were exposed to light levels above 250 lxmEDI for only 14% of their wearing time. This highlights the need for increased exposure to recommended light levels. In the evening, participants were exposed to less than the recommended 10 lxmEDI for 58% of their wearing time, which is in line with the guidelines for reducing light exposure before sleep. This study highlights the urgent need for strategies to increase daily light exposure that are more in line with circadian health recommendations.},
