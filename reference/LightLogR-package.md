# LightLogR: Process Data from Wearable Light Loggers and Optical Radiation Dosimeters

Import, processing, validation, and visualization of personal light
exposure measurement data from wearable devices. The package implements
features such as the import of data and metadata files, conversion of
common file formats, validation of light logging data, verification of
crucial metadata, calculation of common parameters, and semi-automated
analysis and visualization.
