Added aggregate_Datetime() function aggregate data given time interval. Added gg_overview() function get sense timeframe measurement data. Added family regularize functions find deal implicit missing data. functions include dominant_epoch(), gapless_Datetimes(), gap_handler(), gap_finder(). ton updates documentation, unit tests, bug fixes.","code":""},{"path":"https://tscnlab.github.io/LightLogR/news/index.html","id":"lightlogr-020","dir":"Changelog","previous_headings":"","what":"LightLogR 0.2.0","title":"LightLogR 0.2.0","text":"Added Unit tests documentation new functions. filter_Datetime() filter_Date() added option filter group specific dates.
